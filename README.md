## Usage

Simply include these two lines in your hxml:
```
-lib heaps-gltf
--macro hxd.fmt.gltf.Macros.build()
```

## Sample
`haxe sample.hxml && hl sample.hl`

## Resources

Avocado.gltf and related files are public domain assets from [glTF-Sample-Models](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/).


## TODO

* embedded color materials (see [heaps path](https://github.com/mchudleigh/heaps/commit/80cb84bdfec2ee5c4772cb728605bf3aea96491e))
